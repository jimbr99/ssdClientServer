# ssdClientServer
 ssdserver is a server that listens for M-SEARCHes and responds if they match its name.
ssddiscover sends an M-SEARCH query and collects all responses.
Their intent is to allow the client to discover the server's local URL address and connect to the Mosquitto Broker running there and to publish data to the subscriber's webpage there.
